            <p>
                I am a dedicated and driven ICT professional with a strong foundation in software development, holding a National Diploma in ICT from Tshwane University of Technology. My academic journey has been enriched with hands-on experience in database programming (SQL, PL/SQL), programming languages such as C++, ASP.NET, C#, and Java, as well as system analysis and design (Structured Methods and UML).

                            To complement my academic credentials, I am also Microsoft-certified in Data and AI, a testament to my commitment to staying at the forefront of technological advancements.
                            
                            Throughout my career journey, I have consistently demonstrated resilience and adaptability. My experiences range from technical support to leading a top-class project team that developed a successful web app for a local salon. These achievements reflect my ability to combine technical expertise with leadership and problem-solving skills.
                            
                            As I continue to grow professionally, I aim to leverage my technical knowledge and passion for innovation to contribute meaningfully to the tech industry. I am particularly interested in opportunities that challenge me to develop solutions that make a difference while broadening my skillset.
                            
                            Feel free to connect with me to collaborate or explore how I can contribute to your organization's success.
